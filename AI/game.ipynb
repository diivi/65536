    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Game Initialization\n",
    "- The `Game` class is designed to simulate the 2048 game.\n",
    "- It includes an optional graphical user interface (GUI) using the Pygame library.\n",
    "- Users can specify whether to render the GUI for visual representation or run in a non-GUI mode for testing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Game Board\n",
    "- The game board is represented as a grid with customizable dimensions (`GRID_SIZE`) = 4.\n",
    "- 2 tiles are initialized with random values (2 or 4) upon starting the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. User Interface (GUI)\n",
    "- If the GUI is enabled, the simulation renders the game window using Pygame.\n",
    "- Tiles are displayed with appropriate colors, and their values are shown in the center.\n",
    "- A scoring system is implemented to keep track of the user's progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Tile Movement\n",
    "- Users can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right.\n",
    "- Tiles slide as far as possible in the specified direction, merging with adjacent tiles of the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Random Tile Generation\n",
    "- New tiles are added to the grid randomly, with a 90% probability of a 2 and a 10% probability of a 4.\n",
    "- This randomness introduces a dynamic element to the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Scoring\n",
    "- The score is calculated based on the values of merged tiles during movements.\n",
    "- The goal is to achieve the highest score possible through strategic tile merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Game Over Detection\n",
    "- The simulation checks for game-over conditions after each move.\n",
    "- Game over is determined if there are no empty tiles or if no adjacent tiles have the same value.\n",
    "- In GUI mode, a \"Game Over\" message is displayed on the window when the game concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "game = Game(gui=True)  # Creates a new game with GUI\n",
    "# OR\n",
    "game = Game(gui=False)  # Creates a new game without GUI\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Actions\n",
    "- `game.move(direction)`: Performs a move in the specified direction (0: up, 1: right, 2: down, 3: left).\n",
    "- `game.reset()`: Resets the game board to its initial state.\n",
    "- `game.check_game_over()`: Checks if the game is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "game = Game()\n",
    "game.move(1)  # Move tiles to the right\n",
    "game.render()  # Render the updated game state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- The `__str__` method provides a string representation of the current game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- Pygame library (for GUI): Install via `pip install pygame`.\n"

    "### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a popular algorithm used in decision-making processes, particularly in artificial intelligence for games and optimization problems. It is commonly employed when the full state space is too vast to explore exhaustively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree Search:**\n",
    "   - MCTS builds a tree structure representing possible sequences of moves in a game or actions in a decision-making scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monte Carlo Simulation:**\n",
    "   - The algorithm relies on random sampling (Monte Carlo simulations) to explore parts of the decision space, gradually refining its understanding of the most promising choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Four Key Steps:**\n",
    "   - **Selection:** Starting from the root of the tree, traverse down the tree based on certain criteria (often using UCT - Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees) to find a promising node.\n",
    "   - **Expansion:** Expand the selected node by adding one or more child nodes representing possible moves or actions.\n",
    "   - **Simulation:** Conduct a Monte Carlo simulation from the newly added node. This involves making random moves or decisions until a terminal state is reached.\n",
    "   - **Backpropagation:** Update the statistics (e.g., visit count, total reward) of the nodes visited during the simulation. Propagate this information up the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCTS in the Context of 2048 Solver:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection:** The algorithm selects moves (up, down, left, right) based on accumulated statistics, favoring moves that lead to higher scores in the simulations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Expansion:** For each selected move, the algorithm explores possible outcomes by adding child nodes representing different game states.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation:** The `random_policy` function simulates multiple random games from each newly added node to estimate the potential outcomes of the move.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backpropagation:** The results of the simulations are used to update the statistics of the nodes visited during the selection and expansion steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose in 2048 Solver:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimal Move Selection:** MCTS helps the AI make informed decisions on the best move in a given game state.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Decision Making:** By using random simulations, the algorithm adapts to the dynamic nature of the game, providing a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Exploration:** Instead of exhaustively searching the entire decision space, MCTS focuses on promising regions, making it suitable for scenarios with large and uncertain state spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided 2048 solver, MCTS is applied iteratively to determine the best move that maximizes the overall score based on the outcomes of simulated games."

    "# AI Solver using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for 2048\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI agent for 2048 is implemented using the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. This solver aims to make informed decisions about the best move in a given game state by simulating multiple random games and choosing the move that leads to the highest overall score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Random Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `random_policy` function simulates random moves in a given game until a game-over state is reached.\n",
    "- The score and the maximum tile value achieved in the simulated games are recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `mcts` function performs Monte Carlo Tree Search for each possible move (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "- It utilizes the `random_policy` to simulate multiple games and accumulate scores for each move.\n",
    "- The move with the highest accumulated score is selected as the best move.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `monte_carlo_simulation` function applies the MCTS algorithm iteratively until a game-over state is reached.\n",
    "- It prints the final state of the game, the total score, and the maximum tile value achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjust the number of iterations in the `random_policy` function based on computational resources and desired accuracy.\n",
    "- The code assumes the existence of the `Game` class with the `move`, `check_game_over`, and other relevant methods."

    "**Heuristic: Maximizing Score Through Random Simulations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The goal of this heuristic is to maximize the score in the game by selecting the move that yields the highest score in random simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Simulations:** For each valid move, a series of random simulations are conducted using a random policy (`random_policy`). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Score Recording:** The maximum score obtained from the random simulations is recorded for each move, forming a list of scores corresponding to each possible move.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Move Selection:** The move with the highest estimated score is selected, and the initial game state is updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome:**\n",
    "This heuristic is expected to yield a higher score than the other heuristics, as it focuses on maximizing the score through random simulations. But this didn't happen in our case. The reason for this is that the random policy used in the simulations is not optimized for maximizing the score. It is optimized for achieving the highest tile value possible. This is because the score is calculated based on the values of merged tiles, and the highest tile value is achieved by merging tiles of the same value. Therefore, the random policy is biased towards merging tiles of the same value, which may not necessarily lead to the highest score."

    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The objective of this heuristic is to encourage tile merging during the game by considering the mergeability of tiles as a key factor. The heuristic aims to select moves that increase the likelihood of merging tiles during random simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mergeability Policy:** The mergeability of each tile in the game is evaluated by examining its neighboring tiles. For each non-empty tile, the right and down neighbors are checked. If a neighboring tile has the same value, the mergeability score is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Simulations:** For each of the four possible moves (up, right, down, left), a copy of the initial game state is created, and the move is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Score Recording:** The mergeability policy score is added to the heuristic score (`urdl_score`) for each valid move during random simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Move Selection:** The move with the highest average mergeability score is selected, and the initial game state is updated accordingly.\n"

    "**Heuristic: Encouraging Monotonicity in Tile Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The goal of this heuristic is to encourage the monotonicity of tile values in the game grid. Monotonicity implies that the tile values increase or decrease consistently in a particular row or column. The heuristic aims to select moves that increase the overall monotonicity of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Monotonicity Policy:** The monotonicity of each row in the game grid is evaluated by comparing adjacent tile values. If the tile values are in non-decreasing order from left to right, or non-increasing order from left to right, a monotonicity score is calculated. This is done for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Simulations:** For each of the four possible moves (up, right, down, left), a copy of the initial game state is created, and the move is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Score Recording:** The monotonicity policy score is added to the heuristic score (`urdl_score`) for each valid move during random simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Move Selection:** The move with the highest estimated monotonicity score is selected, and the initial game state is updated accordingly.\n"
